/// Creates a new collection in the database with a specified schema.
///
/// This function wraps the database's internal [`add_collection`] call, adding a layer of
/// centralized control and error logging. It validates that the collection name is unique
/// and that the provided structure is a valid JSON object (i.e., the schema).
///
/// This is the recommended way to define and register a new collection in your NoSQL engine.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `db`: A mutable reference to the [`Database`] where the collection should be added.
/// - `name`: A string slice that uniquely identifies the collection.
/// - `structure`: A [`serde_json::Value`] defining the schema for the collection's documents. Must be a JSON object.
/// - `handler`: A mutable reference to a [`NosqliteErrorHandler`] that will log any validation or conflict errors.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// - `Ok(())` if the collection was created and registered successfully.
/// - `Err(NosqliteError)` if:
///   - The name is already taken
///   - The schema is not a valid JSON object
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use serde_json::json;
/// let schema = json!({ "title": "string", "views": "number" });
/// let mut db = Database::default();
/// let mut handler = NosqliteErrorHandler::new("db.nosqlite".to_string());
///
/// create_collection(&mut db, "posts", schema, &mut handler).unwrap();
/// ```
///
/// # Notes
///
/// - This function should be used in admin tooling, migrations, or at startup when defining collection layouts.
/// - Document validation is not enforced at creation time ‚Äî but the schema will be used during insertion.
///
/// # See Also
///
/// - [`delete_collection`] ‚Äî to remove a collection
/// - [`Collection`] ‚Äî the structure being created
/// - [`Database::add_collection`] ‚Äî the core insertion logic

///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `db`: A mutable reference to the [`Database`] instance.
/// - `name`: The name of the collection to remove.
/// - `handler`: A mutable reference to a [`NosqliteErrorHandler`] to record errors if the collection is missing.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// - `Ok(())` if the collection was successfully removed.
/// - `Err(NosqliteError::CollectionNotFound)` if the name was not found in the database.

/// ```rust
/// let mut db = Database::default();
/// let mut handler = NosqliteErrorHandler::new("db.nosqlite".to_string());

/// delete_collection(&mut db, "logs", &mut handler).unwrap();
/// ```
///
/// # Notes
///
/// - All documents in the collection are dropped from memory with this operation.

///
/// - `db`: A reference to the [`Database`] instance.
